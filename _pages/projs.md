### [Charecterization Of the Top Trading Cycle as a Probabilistic Assignment Rule](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04142)
Theorems exist that constrict deterministic assignment rules abiding by to some properties to the TTC algorithm. We analyze the validity of the same when considering probabilistic assignment rules.  

### [Variational Inference Neural Additive Model](https://github.com/saithepaithewhyyy/Vi-NAM-PML)
Took a Neural Additive Model, found a paper that used Laplace Approximation and decided to switch it up and try to improve it by using Variational Inference

### [Infinitely Wide Neural Nets for Small Data Tasks](https://github.com/saithepaithewhyyy/Infinitely-Wide-Neural-Networks-for-Small-Data-Tasks)
Summer research project that got me running weird models backed by cool theory mostly on linux

### [Stochastic Gradient MCMC for Non Linear State Models](https://github.com/saithepaithewhyyy/Stochastic-Gradient-MCMC-for-non-linear-state-models---MTH422)
Was part of the Bayesian Analysis course where we implemented a novel MCMC method on non linear state space models

### [ML based Efficient Frontier in comparision to Modern Portfolio Theory](https://saithepaithewhyyy.github.io/404.html)
Studied theory that basically advised to put all your eggs in one basket - then proceeded to question if ML will suggest the same thing

### [Analysis and Prediction Of Stock Market Data](https://saithepaithewhyyy.github.io/404.html)
Took time series tools and analysed the stock market. Not very complicated - was a course project in Time Series Analysis

### [Spotify Genre Mapping](https://github.com/saithepaithewhyyy/MTH443-Project---Spotify-Genre-Mapping)
A very basic project that applied statistical data mining tools to map songs to genres

### [Advanced NLP - CMU Lectures](https://saithepaithewhyyy.github.io/404.html)
Course notes and assignments and what not from the ANLP lecture notes from CMU
