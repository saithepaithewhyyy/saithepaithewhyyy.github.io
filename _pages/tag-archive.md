## Uhhhhh Still need to add stuff here lol

### [Variational Inference Neural Additive Model](https://github.com/saithepaithewhyyy/Vi-NAM-PML)
Took a Neural Additive Model, found a paper that used Laplace Approximation and decided to switch it up and try to improve it by using Variational Inference

### [Infinitely Wide Neural Nets for Small Data Tasks](https://github.com/saithepaithewhyyy/Infinitely-Wide-Neural-Networks-for-Small-Data-Tasks)
Summer research project that got me running weird models backed by cool theory mostly on linux

### [Stochastic Gradient MCMC for Non Linear State Models](https://github.com/saithepaithewhyyy/Stochastic-Gradient-MCMC-for-non-linear-state-models---MTH422)
Was part of the Bayesian Analysis course where we implemented a novel MCMC method on non linear state space models

### [Spotify Genre Mapping](https://github.com/saithepaithewhyyy/MTH443-Project---Spotify-Genre-Mapping)
A very basic project that applied statistical data mining tools to map songs to genres

### [Personal Blog & Portfolio](https://github.com/saithepaithewhyyy/saithepaithewhyyy.github.io)
