Hey there

I am Sai, and you have stumbled across the little corner of the internet that I have carved out for myself just to let the massive www know that "Hey! I exist!".

About me, I'm a recent graduate from the Indian Institute Of Technology, Kanpur, having completed my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics And Scientific Computing with a minor in Machine Learning. I currently work as a Software Engineer at UKG here in Noida. I'm deeply interested in all things ML, especially in the fine intersection with theoretical statistics. As an undergrad at IITK, I was given the privilege to explore these interests. I completed my first intern at SURGE with Prof. Shankar Prawesh and worked on Infinitely Wide Neural Networks and its associated kernel mapping. My industrial internship was at Ford GDIA as a Data Scientist where I mainly built an LLM based system for data visualization and summarization tasks. Apart from this, I have done multiple projects mostly pertaining to ML, Probabilistic ML, Data Mining and Bayesian Analysis. Go over to the projects tab for more!

Currently I am working with Prof. Soumyarup Sadhukhan on Randomized Allocation Rules and Top Trading Cycles. Apart from this, I have a couple of other side projects cooking up ;).

Enough academia, what about ME? Well what am I if not for the things I do when I have nothing else to do? I love reading, be it books, articles, reseach papers, transcripts, I'll gladly gobble it up. Add music to the mix and I'll disappear from society. My final vice is chess, the hours I've spent are innumerble. Find me on Lichess! What else? Well I do love cooking, eating said cooked food, and sleeping.

Thats about it
Thanks for reading!
